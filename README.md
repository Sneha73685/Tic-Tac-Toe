# Tic-Tac-Toe
## Description
This repository contains a simple Python implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, where two players take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O'). The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
## Features
- Player vs Player mode
- Simple console-based interface
- Win and draw detection
- Easy-to-understand code structure
